         Weld extensions provides a complete set of <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal>s for every annotation type 
         defined by the JSR-299 and JSR-330 specification. These are located in the 
         <literal>org.jboss.weld.extensions.literal</literal> package. Annotations without members provide a static 
         <literal>INSTANCE</literal> member that should be used rather than creating a new instance every time.
