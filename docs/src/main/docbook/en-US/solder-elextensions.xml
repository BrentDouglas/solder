   <title>Evaluating Unified EL</title>
   
   <para>
      Seam Solder provides a method to evaluate EL that is not dependent on JSF or JSP, a facility sadly missing in
      Java EE. To use it inject <code>Expressions</code> into your bean. You can evaluate value expressions, or method
      expressions. The Seam Solder API provides type inference for you. For example: 
   </para>
   
   <programlisting role="JAVA">class FruitBowl {
   
   @Inject Expressions expressions;
  
   public void run() {
      String fruitName = expressions.evaluateValueExpression("#{fruitBowl.fruitName}");
      Apple fruit = expressions.evaluateMethodExpression("#{fruitBown.getFruit}");
   }
}</programlisting>
